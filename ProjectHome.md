PySQLPool is at the heart a MySQL Connection Pooling library for use with the MySQLDB Python bindings.

Part of the PySQLPool is the MySQL Query class that handles all the thread safe connection locking, connection management in association with the Connection Manager, and cursor management. Leaving all the work you have to do in your code is write MySQL Queries. Saving you hours of work.
